 Deployed the application on an AWS EC2 instance using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Virtual 
Private Cloud (VPC) to create a secure and scalable virtual environment. 
 Designed and implemented data models for the application using a NoSQL database MongoDB to handle large 
and unstructured data sets. 
 Exposed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js framework to allow for easy integration with other systems 
and secure communication between the front-end and back-end. 
 Utilized Docker for containerization and CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) to 
automate the building, testing, and deployment of the application.
